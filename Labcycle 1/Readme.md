1. Write a program to read two polynomials and store them in an array. Calculate the sum of the
two polynomials and display the first polynomial, second polynomial and the resultant
polynomial.
2. C Write a program to enter two matrices in normal form . Write a function to convert two
matrices to tuple form and display it. Also find the transpose of the two matrices represented
in tuple form and display it. Find the sum of the two matrices in tuple form and display the
sum in tuple form.
